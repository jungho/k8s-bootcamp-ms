# Kubernetes Bootcamp #

[Kubernetes (K8S)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) is the industry standard for deploying, managing, operating container based distributed applications.  It is proven in the most demanding production environments in the world.  Internet scale companies such as Google, Netflix, EBay and many more depend on Kubernetes to quickly deploy applications and bring product to market faster.

In this bootcamp, we will cover all the essential concepts in Kubernetes. We will go through Kubernetes from the persective of two user personas.

- The Application Engineer that engineers the software solutions deployed to K8S.
- The Platform Engineer that provisions, configures and operates the platform (including cloud services, K8S, CI/CD, databases, message queues, caches, authentication providers, etc) that the Application engineers depends on to bring product to market.

We will also actually deploy a microservice based [application](./todo-app/README.md) to K8S.  Using this reference application, we will learn K8S concepts in a more meaningful way - as if you were using K8S to deploy and manage a real application.  We will cover scenarios such as:

- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
- Blue/Green deployments
- Deploying multiple versions of your application to perform A/B testing
- Auto-scaling your application to deal with peak traffic demand
- Developing/testing/deploying your application - from your laptop to K8S - with focus on developer productivity
- RBAC (Role Based Access Control) to ensure Production environments are isolated from Dev/Test and QA.
- Many more.

By the end of this 2-day bootcamp, you will learn the following K8S concepts:

- [Pods - the unit of deployment on K8S](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/)
- [Services - how service discovery works in K8S](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/connect-applications-service/)
- [Deployments - doing rolling updates, rollbacks, scaling out](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)
- [Storage - managing durable state with volumes, persistance volumes and persistent volume claims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/)
- [Secrets - externalizing secrets and passwords](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/)
- [ConfigMaps - externalizing configuration from your applications](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configmap/)
- [Statefulsets - how to deploy stateful applications](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/)
- [Jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/)
- [Daemon Sets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/)
- [Ingress and Ingress Controllers - key to controlling how requests originating from outside the cluster is routed to your services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)
- [RBAC - locking down your K8S environment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/)
- [Monitoring and log aggregation](./monitoring-logging/README.md)
- [Helm - packaging and deploying your application to K8S](https://docs.helm.sh/)

    - Using load-balancers and NodePorts to expose your pods to clients outside your cluster
    - Accessing services external to your cluster. e.g. Azure CosmosDB service

- [Storage](./storage/README.md) - Volumes, Persistent Volumes, Persistence Volume Claims, Storage Classes.
- [ConfigMaps](./configmaps/README.md) - ConfigMaps enable you to define configuration that is accessible as environment variables, files in a volume or command line arguments.
- [Ingress](./ingress/README.md) - Customizing the routing your published services.
    - Deploying the nginx ingress controller
    - Configuring routing to different version of your services
- [Introduction to Helm](./helm/README.md) - Package manager for K8S deployments.
    - What is it and why you need it
    - Deploying the Todo list application using Helm
    - Charts and templates
    - Sharing your charts

### Day 2 Outline: ###

- [Daemonsets](./daemonsets/README.md) - Running pods that need to run on all or some nodes continuously e.g. for log aggregation.
- [Jobs](./jobs/README.md) - Deploying jobs on K8S.
- [Statefulsets](./statefulsets/README.md) - Using statefulsets to deploy services that require role differentiation across the cluster.  For example, mysql database with master and slaves.
- [Advanced Scheduling](./scheduling/README.md) - Controlling how your pods are scheduled to the nodes.
- [Securing your cluster](./security/README.md) - Controlling access to your K8S cluster.
    - K8S authn/authr model
    - RBAC
        - Roles and Role bindings
        - Creating custom roles and role bindings to only allow access to a specific namespace (e.g. qa or dev)

- Brief overview of other K8S tools and projects you should know about:
    - [Draft](./app-dev/README.md) - Tool to help developers be productive building/testing applications on K8S
    - [Skaffold](./app-dev/README.md) - Similar to Draft but takes different approach.  Skaffold also supports multi-component apps which is very nice.
